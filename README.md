# React Portfolio
As a new developer, the React Portfolio to demonstrate my experience building single-page applications. This application shows a deployed portfolio using React to showcase projects and development skills. 

## Description 
The application was designed using React. When user navigates to the page, they will see a Header, Navigation tabs and Footer that persists through each page. The Navigation tabs will list options for the following pages: About, Project Portfolio, Resume and Contact. When user clicks on tab, they will be taken to the corresponding page. The Project Portfolio page will display six projects with titles and links to GitHub pages and, if applicable, Heroku pages. The Resume page will have a brief summary of skills and the option to open or download a pdf version of the resume. The Contact page will have to input options of name, email and message. If user clicks away from text input area, they will be alerted that fields are required. The application will also check that user email is valid. The Footer of the page shows links for external pages to LinkedIn, GitHub and email.
